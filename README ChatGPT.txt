Project Information
-------------------
This repository contains code developed for academic research.

Use of AI Assistance
--------------------
Portions of the code in this repository were developed with the assistance of ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, USA).
The AI tool was used to suggest code structure, syntax, and debugging strategies.

All code has been reviewed, tested, and verified by the authors, who are responsibility for its accuracy and integrity.

Authorship
----------
In line with current journal and publisher guidelines, ChatGPT is not listed as an author and does not meet authorship criteria. 
All intellectual responsibility for the work rests with the human authors.
